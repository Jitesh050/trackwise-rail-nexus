# Smart-Rail Project Structure

## Overview
This project follows a modular, microservices-inspired architecture for scalable, maintainable development of a smart railway system. Below is a brief description of each major folder and its purpose.

---

## Directory Structure

- **Frontend/**
  - Contains all React/TypeScript frontend code.
  - Structure: `src/`, `public/`, and all frontend config files (Vite, Tailwind, etc.).

- **backend/**
  - Express.js backend for API gateway and business logic.
  - `controllers/` — Handles incoming requests.
  - `routes/` — Defines API endpoints.
  - `services/` — Core backend logic (e.g., trip planning, chatbot integration).

- **ai-services/**
  - Microservices for AI/ML models.
  - `trip-planner-ai/` — Route planning intelligence.
  - `chatbot-ai/` — NLP and chatbot logic.
  - `common/` — Shared AI utilities.

- **simulation/**
  - Tools and code for simulating railway operations and visualizations.

- **iot/**
  - IoT device integrations and related code.

- **database/**
  - Database schemas, migrations, and management scripts.

- **docs/**
  - Project documentation, guides, and specifications.

- **config/**
  - Configuration files for deployment, CI/CD, and environment management.

## Where to Add Features
- **Frontend:** UI, user flows, and integrations with backend APIs.
- **backend:** New API endpoints, business logic, and data orchestration.
- **ai-services:** ML models, chatbot enhancements, or route optimization logic.
- **simulation/iot/database:** Expand as needed for simulation, hardware, or data features.
